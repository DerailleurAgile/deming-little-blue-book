### Communication
Break down barriers between departments. People in research, design, sales and production must work as a team, to foresee problems of production and in use that may be encountered with the product or service. **[Out 24]**

### Competition
Economists are leading us down the wrong path. They tell us that fierce competition is the solution. We worry about increasing market share and we try to kill off colleagues in the same industry, instead of making better products.

### Customers
The customer is the most important part of the production line. Without him, there is no production line. Improvement of quality envelopes the entire production line, from incoming materials to the consumer, and redesign of the product and service for the future. **[World 24]**

Price has no meaning except in terms of the product. But that is not enough. Good and uniform quality have no meaning except with reference to the consumer's needs. **[World 65]**

### Education
I find a general fear of education. People are afraid to take a course. It might not be the right one. My advice is take it. Find the right one later... You never know what could be used, what could be needed. He that thinks he has to be practical is not going to be here very long. Who knows what is practical? Help people to improve. I mean everybody. **[Method 84]**

### Evaluation
Most of us assume that if we don’t evaluate you, you won’t be motivated to work better. So we interview you and measure you, compare you to others, and try to place you in a ranking. Instead we need to promote self-esteem, joy in work and pride in what we do, so that we encourage people to innovate and contribute to the job. If we destroy you, you are humiliated. Ranking you destroys you.

### Fear
Fear takes a horrible toll. Fear is all around, robbing people of their pride, hurting them, robbing them of a chance to contribute to the company. It is unbelievable what happens when you unloose fear. **[Method 73]**

### Improvement
The only reason to carry out a test is to improve a process, to improve the quality and quality of the next run or of next year's crop. Important questions in science and industry are how and under what conditions observations may contribute to a rational decision to change or not to change a process to accomplish improvement. A record of observations must accordingly contain all the information that anyone might need in order to make his own prediction. **[World 99]**

A company that is healthy and doing well is in excellent position to improve management, product and service, thus to contribute to the economic welfare of itself and to the rest of us. Moreover, it has the greatest obligation to improve. A monopoly is in fact in the best position to improve year by year, and has the greatest obligation to do so. A company that is on the rocks can think only of survival. **[New 16]**

Putting out fires is not improvement. Finding a point out of control, finding the special cause and removing it, is only putting the process back to where it was in the first place. It is not improvement of the process. **[Method 67]**

We're losing ground because what we are doing is wrong, even though we work very hard and give our best effort.

### Joy in Work
I love my work. It’s fun for me. I wish American management to keep learning and growing and I wish to keep learning and sharing with them. **[World 13]** *This was Dr. Deming’s reply when he was asked why he spent five to seven days a week traveling, teaching, consulting and giving four-day seminars to hundreds of students.*

### Knowledge
Who is it that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? (Job 38:2) **[Out 1]**

My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. (Hosea 4:6) **[Out 97]**

For in much wisdom is great grief; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow. (Ecclesiastes 1:16) **[Out 371]**

Profound knowledge** of a system comes from outside, rarely from the inside. Have you ever found someone who has profound knowledge inside an organization? I never have.  
### The understanding needed to improve a system.

### Leadership
Drive out fear, so everybody may work effectively for the company. **[Out 23]**

Eliminate work standards (quotas) on the factory floor. Substitute leadership.

Eliminate management by objective. Eliminate management by numbers and numerical goals. Abolish the merit system and the ranking system. Substitute leadership. **[Out 24]**

Judge each part of a system by its contribution to the system, not for its individual performance. Each part is responsible for the health and well-being of the whole system.

### Learning
Learning is not compulsory.  
Survival is not compulsory.

### Management
My theory of management says that every person gains when the system is optimized.

Management must always improve the system. Do what is best for the whole system; don’t do things the way they have always been done. Remember: you can’t have impact unless you break away from the system. You must be outside of the system.

It is easy to manage a business in an expanding market, and easy to suppose that economic conditions can only grow better and better. In contrast with expectations, we find, on looking back, that we have been on an economic decline for three decades. It is easy to date an earthquake, but not a decline. **[New 5]**

The manager should be a leader. He should understand how his work and the work of his people fit into the system. Optimization of a system is the first job of a leader.  
Recognize that all people are different, try to fit each one in what he does best, what he takes joy in doing.

Most people think of management as a chain of command. My theory says that the system is like an orchestra, not an army. Every one in an orchestra supports the other players. Each player watches not only the conductor, but also each other and the whole system. The system needs a conductor, not a general. It needs someone who harmonizes the talents and abilities of each part of the system. Each player in the orchestra knows that he is part of a system, even when he plays solo. He is not there to attract attention to himself. He succeeds when he supports the other players.

Without a cultural revolution in management, quality control circles will not produce the desired effects in America. Nor can anyone guarantee that job security for the rank and file would be enough to produce high productivity and product quality. However, without management’s commitment to the personal welfare of its workers, it will be impossible to inspire employees’ interest in company productivity and product quality. With guaranteed security, management’s job becomes far more difficult and challenging. **[Out 148]**

### Merit Pay
See Evaluation

### Obstacles
Barriers against realization of pride of workmanship may in fact be one of the most important obstacles to reduction of cost and improvement of quality in the United States. **[Out 83]**

### Optimization
Labor and management should focus on optimizing the system. For any discussion between buyer and seller or suppliers and retailers, the rule is the same. If your principal goal in a negotiation is to protect yourself, you’ve already lost and so has everyone else. You gain most when you work with others to improve the system.

Any group should have as its aim optimization over the unit of the larger system that the group operates in. Anything less than optimization of the whole system will bring eventual loss to every component in the system. **[New 59]**

### Patience
How poor are they that have not patience.  
Iago to Roderigo, Shakespeare’s *Othello*, II, iii **[Out 29]**

### A Plea for Blood
There are two kinds of blood in the blood bank, good and bad. **[My physician]** Dr. Burchell used three units of good blood on me. Bad blood, he said, is a last resort. People like my friends and your friends can give good blood, and that is about the only source thereof. Blood from a regular donor that takes pay for it is almost dependably pretty well washed up, like the donor himself, if I understand Dr. Burchell correctly. In other words, good blood comes from friends and their friends. Money cannot buy it: it is not for sale. I may have garbled some of the medical language here, but Dr. Burchell’s point was very clear. He and other surgeons need good blood. Any type will do as replacement. In short, I owe three pints of good blood, and there is only one way to replace them. Money won’t do it. I had not appreciated these critical requirements. Maybe this plea will bring friends to offer blood. **[World 142]**

### Productivity
Improve constantly and forever the system of production and service, to improve quality and productivity and thus constantly decrease costs. **[Out 23]**

### Profits
Don’t depend on short-term profits as a measure of a system’s health. They often get that way by cutting back on long-term investment. Cutting back may mean laying off people, reducing research and postponing maintenance, but the system suffers.

Paper profits do not make the pie bigger. They give you a bigger piece. You take it from somebody else. It doesn’t help the society. **[Method 91]**

Dividends and paper profits, the yardstick by which managers of money and heads of companies are judged, do not improve the competitive position of a company or of American industry. Paper profits do not make bread: improvement of quality and productivity do. They make a contribution to better material living for all people, here and everywhere. **[Out 21]**

### Protectionism
Dependence on protection by tariffs and laws to “buy American” only encourages incompetence. **[Out xi]**

If some manufacturers in my own country would meet competition with effort and spend less time on lobbies to boost tariffs and to lower trade quotas, they might have less to worry about Japanese competition and could give some of the rest of us the benefit of better quality and lower prices. Many people say that they believe in free enterprise in competition, but what they often mean is competition for the other fellow, not for themselves. Now in my own case, I believe in free enterprise, and I am not afraid of Japanese statisticians, English statisticians, French statisticians, or any others. If one of them is doing a better job, then the thing to do is go over there, or bring him to my own country, and find out how he does it. I don’t know of any statistician’s lobby to try to keep out foreign statisticians. The more of them we import, the better off we are. **[World 43–44]**

### Quality
Why is it that productivity increases as quality improves? Less rework. Not so much waste. Quality to the production worker means that his performance satisfies him, provides to him pride of workmanship. **[Out 1]**

End the practice of awarding business on the basis of price tag. Instead, minimize total cost. Move toward a single supplier of any one item, on a long-term relationship of loyalty and trust. **[Out 23]**

Japanese management learned in 1950… that the best solution to improvement of incoming materials is to make a partner of every vendor, and to work together with him on a long-term relationship of loyalty and trust. **[Out 43]**

Barriers against realization of pride of workmanship may in fact be one of the most important obstacles to reduction of cost and improvement of quality in the United States. **[Out 83]**

Quality begins at the top. . . . Quality of product and of service can be no better than the intent of top management. The only way a company can achieve success would be for the top management to be committed to the course of action. **[World 22]**

Cease dependence on inspection to improve quality. Eliminate the need for inspection on a mass basis by building quality into the product in the first place. **[Out 23]**

Work with your vendor to improve his incoming quality. Establish a long-term relationship with him for continual improvement, ever better and better quality, with lower and lower costs. Both you and he will win. **[World 10]**

### Ranking
See Evaluation.

### Responsibility
It is no longer socially acceptable to dump employees onto the heap of unemployment. Loss of market and resulting unemployment are not foreordained. They are not inevitable. They are man-made. **[Out ix]**

The greatest waste in America is failure to use the abilities of people. One need only listen to a tape of a meeting with production workers to learn about their frustrations and about the contribution that they are eager to make. Anyone would be impressed to observe how articulate most production workers are, in spite of criticisms of our schools. **[Out 53]**

### Shewhart, William A. 1891–1967
Another half century may pass before the full spectrum of Dr. Shewhart’s contributions has been revealed in liberal education, science and industry. **[World 53]**

### Statistics
There are conferences almost any day in this country on the subject of productivity, mostly concerned with gadgets and measures of productivity. As William E. Conway said, measurements of productivity are like accident statistics. They tell you that there is a problem, but they don’t do anything about accidents. This book (*Out of the Crisis*) is an attempt to improve productivity, not just to measure it. **[Out x]**

The application of statistical principles and techniques in all stages of production are directed toward the economic manufacture of a product that is useful and has a market. **[World 42]**

A process is in statistical control when it is no longer afflicted with special causes. **[Out x]**

### Performance
A process that is in statistical control is predictable. **[World 100]**

A professional statistician will not follow methods that are indefensible, merely to please someone, nor to support inferences based on such methods. He ranks his own name and profession as more important than convenient assent to interpretations not warranted by statistical theory. “…His career as an expert witness will shatter in shipwreck if he indicates concern over which side of the case the results seem to favor. ‘As a statistician, I couldn’t care less,’ is the right attitude in a legal case, or in any other report.” **[World 106]**

Most statisticians can recall instances in which informal advice backfired. It is the same in any professional line. A statistician that tries to be a good fellow and give advice under adverse circumstances is in practice and has a client, whether he intended it or not; he will later on find himself accountable for the advice. **[World 120]**

### Transformation
Long-term commitment to new learning and new philosophy is required of any management that seeks transformation. The timid and the fainthearted, and people that expect quick results, are doomed to disappointment. **[Out x]**

Put everybody in the company to work to accomplish the transformation. The transformation is everybody’s job. **[Out 24]**

### Variation
Some leaders forget an important mathematical theorem that if 20 people are engaged in a job, two will fall in the bottom ten percent, no matter what. It is difficult to overthrow the law of gravitation and the laws of nature. The important problem is not the bottom ten percent, but who is statistically out of line and in need of help. **[Out 56]**

Thousands of people understand that investigation of ups and downs within the control limits creates trouble, increases variation, causes severe loss. These same people forget the basic scientific principles that they have learned **[when they go onto]** the factory floor; those same scientific principles apply to people. People are the most important asset of any company. **[Method 248]**

What statistical methods do is to point out the existence of special causes. A point beyond limits on a control chart, or a significant result in an experiment or test, indicates almost certainly the existence of one or more special causes. Points in control, or which show no significance, indicate that only common causes of variation remain. **[World 46]**

Management has the obligation to focus attention on common causes of variability among specific causes. Common causes affect all machines and all operators. Only management can change a common cause; the worker cannot. No matter how well an operator or foreman does his work, his efforts may be ineffective if he is handicapped by poor light, raw material that is too variable or otherwise unsuitable, or by any other common cause. This is why management must continually accept the responsibility to find common causes, and to eliminate them if economically feasible. **[World 247]**

### Work
Anyone with a job is entitled to pride of workmanship. **[World 254]**

### Other Quotations
Wisdom sounds foolish to fools.  
Dionysius to Cadmus in Euripides’ *The Bacchae* **[Out 486]**

Is it the bell that rings,  
Is it the hammer that rings,  
Or is it the meeting of the two that rings?  
– Japanese poem **[Out 177]**

"Experience by itself teaches nothing...Without theory, experience has no meaning. Without theory, one has no questions to ask. Hence without theory there is no learning."

Foremost is the principle that the purpose of consumer research is to understand the customer’s needs and wishes, and thus design product and service that will provide better living for him in the future. A second principle is that no one can guess the future loss of business from a dissatisfied customer…"

“What is a system? A system is a network of interdependent components that work together to try to accomplish the aim of the system. A system must have an aim. Without an aim, there is no system. The aim of the system must be clear to everyone in the system. The aim must include plans for the future. The aim is a value judgment. (We are of course talking here about a man-made system.)”
