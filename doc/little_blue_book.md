# The Little Blue Book of Dr. Deming's Quotations

**Communication**  
Break down barriers between departments. People in research, design, sales and production must work as a team, to foresee problems of production and in use that may be encountered with the product or service. [Out 24]

**Competition**  
Economists are leading us down the wrong path. They tell us that fierce competition is the solution. We worry about increasing market share and we try to kill off colleagues in the same industry, instead of making better products.

**Customers**  
The customer is the most important part of the production line. Without him, there is no production line. Improvement of quality envelopes the entire production line, from incoming materials to the consumer, and redesign of the product and service for the future. [World 24]

Price has no meaning except in terms of the product. But that is not enough. Good and uniform quality have no meaning except with reference to the consumer's needs. [Word 65]

**Education**  
I find a general fear of education. People are afraid to take a course. It might not be the right one. My advice is take it. Find the right one later... You never know what could be used, what could be needed. He that thinks he has to be practical is not going to be here very long. Who knows what is practical? Help people to improve. I mean everybody. [Method 84]

**Evaluation**  
Most of us assume that if we don’t evaluate you, you won’t be motivated to work better. So we interview you and measure you, compare you to others, and try to place you in a ranking. Instead we need to promote self-esteem, joy in work and pride in what we do, so that we encourage people to innovate and contribute to the job. If we destroy you, you are humiliated. Ranking you destroys you.

**Fear**  
Fear takes a horrible toll. Fear is all around, robbing people of their pride, hurting them, robbing them of a chance to contribute to the company. It is unbelievable what happens when you unloose fear. [Method 73]

**Improvement**  
The only reason to carry out a test is to improve a process, to improve the quality and quality of the next run or of next year's crop. Important questions in science and industry are how and under what conditions observations may contribute to a rational decision to change or not to change a process to accomplish improvement. A record of observations must accordingly contain all the information that anyone might need in order to make his own prediction. [World 99]

A company that is healthy and doing well is in excellent position to improve management, product and service, thus to contribute to the economic welfare of itself and to the rest of us. Moreover, it has the greatest obligation to improve. A monopoly is in fact in the best position to improve year by year, and has the greatest obligation to do so. A company that is on the rocks can think only of survival. [New 16]

Putting out fires is not improvement. Finding a point out of control, finding the special cause and removing it, is only putting the process back to where it was in the first place. It is not improvement of the process. [Method 67]

We're losing ground because what we are doing is wrong, even though we work very hard and give our best effort.

**Joy in Work**  
I love my work. It’s fun for me. I wish American management to keep learning and growing and I wish to keep learning and sharing with them. [World 13] *This was Dr. Deming’s reply when he was asked why he spent five to seven days a week traveling, teaching, consulting and giving four-day seminars to hundreds of students.*

**Knowledge**  
Who is it that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? (Job 38:2) [Out 1]

My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. (Hosea 4:6) [Out 97]

For in much wisdom is great grief; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow. (Ecclesiastes 1:16) [Out 371]

Profound knowledge** of a system comes from outside, rarely from the inside. Have you ever found someone who has profound knowledge inside an organization? I never have.  
**The understanding needed to improve a system.**

**Leadership**  
Drive out fear, so everybody may work effectively for the company. [Out 23]

Eliminate work standards (quotas) on the factory floor. Substitute leadership.

Eliminate management by objective. Eliminate management by numbers and numerical goals. Abolish the merit system and the ranking system. Substitute leadership. [Out 24]

Judge each part of a system by its contribution to the system, not for its individual performance. Each part is responsible for the health and well-being of the whole system.

**Learning**  
Learning is not compulsory.  
Survival is not compulsory.

**Management**  
My theory of management says that every person gains when the system is optimized.

Management must always improve the system. Do what is best for the whole system; don’t do things the way they have always been done. Remember: you can’t have impact unless you break away from the system. You must be outside of the system.

It is easy to manage a business in an expanding market, and easy to suppose that economic conditions can only grow better and better. In contrast with expectations, we find, on looking back, that we have been on an economic decline for three decades. It is easy to date an earthquake, but not a decline. [New 5]

The manager should be a leader. He should understand how his work and the work of his people fit into the system. Optimization of a system is the first job of a leader.  
Recognize that all people are different, try to fit each one in what he does best, what he takes joy in doing.

Most people think of management as a chain of command. My theory says that the system is like an orchestra, not an army. Every one in an orchestra supports the other players. Each player watches not only the conductor, but also each other and the whole system. The system needs a conductor, not a general. It needs someone who harmonizes the talents and abilities of each part of the system. Each player in the orchestra knows that he is part of a system, even when he plays solo. He is not there to attract attention to himself. He succeeds when he supports the other players.

Without a cultural revolution in management, quality control circles will not produce the desired effects in America. Nor can anyone guarantee that job security for the rank and file would be enough to produce high productivity and product quality. However, without management’s commitment to the personal welfare of its workers, it will be impossible to inspire employees’ interest in company productivity and product quality. With guaranteed security, management’s job becomes far more difficult and challenging. [Out 148]
