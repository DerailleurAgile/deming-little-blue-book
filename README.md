### Introduction  
The purpose of this book of quotations is neither to summarize Dr. Deming‚Äôs work nor to ‚Äúpopularize‚Äù his ideas by giving the reader a quick overview. This book does not give you the *essence* of Deming. Rather, the purpose of compiling these quotes is to stir your interest to learn more. **Why does Deming advocate the end of merit pay? Why must managers understand terms like ‚Äústatistical control‚Äù and ‚Äúvariation‚Äù?** You won‚Äôt find complete answers here, just quotations for you to meditate on and to ponder. The page references will speed your self-education. Yes, today‚Äôs world of sound bites, briefings, news summaries and shortened attention spans make Dr. Deming‚Äôs work hard to communicate to a generation growing up on MTV and the Internet and to a work force committed to intense adversarial competition. Rather than try to chop Deming‚Äôs philosophy of ‚Äúmanaging the system‚Äù into 20-second sound bites, we have selected quotes that will raise your interest to spend a half hour or more to learn more about the subject.

### The 14 Points  
We decided to include just three of Dr. Deming‚Äôs famous 14 points. If you are moved to find the list of the 14 points and the seven diseases, then *The Little Blue Book* has achieved its main purpose: to motivate you to read *Out of the Crisis* and other tomes that explain the Deming philosophy of management.

We have not included all of the 14 points and we have omitted the extensive explanations of each point that Deming, his disciples and interpreters have invested many years in developing. This *Little Blue Book* will get you started.

### The Little Blue Book
*Without a cultural revolution in management, **quality** control will not produced the desired effects in America.*

 ‚ÄîW. Edwards Deming, *Out of the Crisis*, p. 148

In his foreword to the second edition of *Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-Tung*, Lin Piao exhorted his readers to ‚Äúhave specific problems in mind, study and apply his [Mao‚Äôs] words in a creative way, combine study with application.‚Äù The reader of this little book is encouraged to apply the same advice to Dr. Deming‚Äôs words.

Students of Chinese history will recall that the phrase ‚Äúcultural revolution‚Äù and a certain little red book intended to provide the guiding principles for modernizing a country or one billion people. Unlike Deng, whose work empowers those who understand and use the ideas, Mao Tse Tung (Zedong) perverted the phrase ‚Äúcultural revolution‚Äù so that those two words continue to revive painful memories in millions of survivors of that ill-conceived plan.

We hope that these quotations from Dr. Deming‚Äôs work will inspire you to join the larger ‚Äúcultural revolution‚Äù in management. This revolution will change not only you, your colleagues, your employees and your neighbors, but also billions of people around the globe, including those who studied Chairman Mao‚Äôs little red book and failed to find fulfillment. ‚ÄúPeace through economic prosperity‚Äù is Dr. Deming‚Äôs promise to those who heed his call for the pursuit of **quality**.

### Endnotes  
In 1992 **Richard Stockton Conger**, a political science student at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, compiled a collection of quotations by looking through his notes from lectures by Deming. His 48-page book measured 11 cm by 11 cm and it had a blue cover. The current editors in 1994 obtained permission letters and reissued the book in a smaller format (smaller than a 3‚Äù by 5‚Äù card) of 72 pages, calling it ‚Äúthe Little Blue Book.‚Äù In 2010 the document was placed on scribd.com with the purpose of sharing the work with people who are concerned about improving the **quality** of management, services and products.
