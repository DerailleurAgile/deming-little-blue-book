### Introduction  
The purpose of this book of quotations is neither to summarize Dr. Deming’s work nor to “popularize” his ideas by giving the reader a quick overview. This book does not give you the *essence* of Deming. Rather, the purpose of compiling these quotes is to stir your interest to learn more. **Why does Deming advocate the end of merit pay? Why must managers understand terms like “statistical control” and “variation”?** You won’t find complete answers here, just quotations for you to meditate on and to ponder. The page references will speed your self-education. Yes, today’s world of sound bites, briefings, news summaries and shortened attention spans make Dr. Deming’s work hard to communicate to a generation growing up on MTV and the Internet and to a work force committed to intense adversarial competition. Rather than try to chop Deming’s philosophy of “managing the system” into 20-second sound bites, we have selected quotes that will raise your interest to spend a half hour or more to learn more about the subject.

### The 14 Points  
We decided to include just three of Dr. Deming’s famous 14 points. If you are moved to find the list of the 14 points and the seven diseases, then *The Little Blue Book* has achieved its main purpose: to motivate you to read *Out of the Crisis* and other tomes that explain the Deming philosophy of management.

We have not included all of the 14 points and we have omitted the extensive explanations of each point that Deming, his disciples and interpreters have invested many years in developing. This *Little Blue Book* will get you started.

### The Little Blue Book
Without a cultural revolution in management, **quality** control will not produced the desired effects in America. —W. Edwards Deming, *Out of the Crisis*, p. 148

In his foreword to the second edition of *Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-Tung*, Lin Piao exhorted his readers to “have specific problems in mind, study and apply his [Mao’s] words in a creative way, combine study with application.” The reader of this little book is encouraged to apply the same advice to Dr. Deming’s words.

Students of Chinese history will recall that the phrase “cultural revolution” and a certain little red book intended to provide the guiding principles for modernizing a country or one billion people. Unlike Deng, whose work empowers those who understand and use the ideas, Mao Tse Tung (Zedong) perverted the phrase “cultural revolution” so that those two words continue to revive painful memories in millions of survivors of that ill-conceived plan.

We hope that these quotations from Dr. Deming’s work will inspire you to join the larger “cultural revolution” in management. This revolution will change not only you, your colleagues, your employees and your neighbors, but also billions of people around the globe, including those who studied Chairman Mao’s little red book and failed to find fulfillment. “Peace through economic prosperity” is Dr. Deming’s promise to those who heed his call for the pursuit of **quality**. Let’s begin.
